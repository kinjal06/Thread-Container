# Thread-Container
The BlockingQueue class has a constructor that takes capacity as the input and initializes the queue with the capacity specified. The add () method takes item as the argument of any data type. It has The class unique_lock which is a general-purpose mutex ownership wrapper allowing deferred locking, time-constrained attempts at locking, recursive locking, transfer of lock ownership, and is used with condition variable. The condition variables cond_add and cond_remove are created in order to avoid continuous polling of the state of the queue.
If the condition variable is notified in the add method, then the waiting remove thread will wake. The add function will also block the caller until the space is available. this functionality is achieved by checking the size of the queue should not exceed the capacity.
The remove function blocks the caller until item is available for retrieval. After removal of the item producer thread is notified using the con_add condition variable. This ensures that no thread is in a blocking state and the design is workable for n producer threads and m consumer threads.
The clear method clears the items in the queue which are not retrieved by remove method but it does not clear the waiting calls. The shutdown method clears/ kills the waiting threads. The flag shutdown keeps track of whether the queue is open or closed.
